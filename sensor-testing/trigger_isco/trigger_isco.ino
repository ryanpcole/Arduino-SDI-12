 * @brief Wait a certain amount of time and then trigger an ISCO sample
 *
 * This is a simple demonstration of triggering an ISCO using an arduino
 *
 * It waits a certain amount of time then triggers the pump to take a sample
 * 
 * TODO  I need to figure out exactly what kind of signal it takes to trigger a sample.
 *       Also is it a specific signal to trigger a sample or do different signals affect
 *       the programming in the ISCO
 * 
 * Or do I have to program the ISCO independently?
 *
